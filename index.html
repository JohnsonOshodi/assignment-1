        <p>Name: Johnson Samson Oshodi</p>
        <p>Student ID: ALT/SOE/023/3732</p>
        <p>Brief:</p>
        <p> I'm a middle age man precisely early 40's, Married with 3 grown kids with a fair background in the
            telecommuincation industry, I work for over a decade in the telecoms industry in South Africa before
            relocating back to Nigeria due to Xenophobia attack on foreign Nationals in 2019.</p>
        <p>With my wide range of experience in Sales, Networking, RF installation and Real estate I still find myself
            eager to learn and grow into new space especially in this global Tech dispensation, as a Tech enthusiast, I
            have passion for building systems, softwares, critical thinking space where I can take on new challenges and
            be a free thinker. I actually found software engineering intresting and I'm passionate about it.</p>
        <p>I choose software engineering with the hope of becoming a full stack engineer someday soon, and I'm willing
            and ready to go all the way out for it. Although my learning has been slow for the past 8 weeks since the
            journey started but I know for sure I will scale through.</p>

        <p>My goal in AltSchool:</p>
        <p>My goal is simply to aquire knowledge/ skills as much as I can so I can be fully equipped to secure my spot
            in the Tech industry, bringing on innovative ideas to build systems, get on projects and also to network
            because I've chosen this career path and I believe AltSchool Africa is the best I can have access to and I'm
            greatful to be one of the learners.</p>
